# Overnight Index-Futures Framework (夜盘 read)

How to answer "今天/现在哪里在影响 NQ 夜盘" — a *market-level* attribution read, distinct from single-name analysis. Output is always: current tape → ranked drivers with numbers → catalyst clock → base/bull/bear scenarios keyed to levels. Productized as the funda-app `overnight-futures` play (PR #4007); this file is the human/agent version of the same discipline.

## 0. Session clock (all ET)

| Window | What is live |
|---|---|
| 18:00 open (Sun–Thu) | Globex reopens; prior 17:00 settle is the anchor |
| 19:00–20:00 | Tokyo pre-open; JP data drops (trade balance 19:50, CPI Thu 19:30) |
| 20:00–02:00 | **Asia cash live**: Tokyo 20:00–02:00, Seoul 21:00–01:30, HK 21:30–04:00 |
| ~02:00–03:00 | Korea-morning corporate releases (SK Hynix / Samsung prints ≈ US 2–3 AM) |
| 03:00–09:30 | Europe cash + ECB (Thu 12:15/12:45 UTC in summer) |
| 08:30 | US data block (claims, CPI, etc.) — still "overnight" for positioning purposes |
| 09:30–16:00 | RTH; 17:00 settle; 17:00–18:00 maintenance break |

Foreign catalysts land **inside** the US night: a "7/22 KST" earnings date means tonight for the US session. Always convert before saying "no catalysts tonight."

## 1. Tape first

- NQ now vs **prior settle** (= live price − change on the quote), overnight high/low, and the path (grinding vs one-shot gap). A −0.3% drift and a −0.3% news gap are different animals.
- Compare with the prior **cash** session: a big RTH rally + flat/slightly-red overnight = digestion, not reversal. Don't narrate a −0.25% give-back as "selling off."
- Sample the trend with ≥2 points before calling direction (same rule as the MU after-hours lesson — one snapshot is not a trend).

## 2. The three-complex divergence read (core signal)

Read three groups against each other; the *divergence pattern* is the attribution:

| Pattern | Read |
|---|---|
| NQ↓ while gold/silver/oil↑ (DXY firm) | **Inflation/energy/geopolitics drag** on duration, not broad risk-off |
| NQ↓ while Asia cash (KOSPI/Nikkei) rips | Drag is **US-specific** (tariffs, US politics, US rates) — Asia bid limits downside |
| NQ↓, Asia↓, gold↑, oil↓ | Genuine **growth scare / risk-off** |
| NQ↑ with oil↑ + gold flat | Risk-on with a cyclical tint; don't over-read |
| Everything up, VIX crushed | Pre-event complacency — check what event is being front-run (§3) and note protection is cheap |

- Complexes: (a) equity futures NQ/ES/YM/RTY; (b) safe-haven/inflation: gold, silver, WTI/Brent, DXY, ZN; (c) live Asia cash: Nikkei, KOSPI, HSI (HK often diverges from JP/KR on China-specific fear — say which Asia).
- KOSPI/Nikkei fading from session highs while NQ drifts = the "Asia floor" thinning intra-night. Re-check mid-session; the 21:00 read expires by 01:00.

## 3. Catalyst clock

- Next 24–72h: high-impact macro prints (High everywhere + Medium US), mega-cap earnings (amc/bmo), central-bank decisions/pressers, **and foreign prints converted to ET** (§0).
- Flag what already dropped tonight (actual vs estimate) — a beat that Asia is trading on right now is a live driver, not a future one.
- **Fed blackout awareness**: in the ~10 days pre-FOMC there are no Fed speakers to counter a hawkish/dovish narrative — narratives run unopposed. Note it explicitly when a rate story is moving the tape.
- Un-dropped binary inside the night (e.g., a Korea-morning memory print) = open gap risk both ways; the pre-positioning (KOSPI front-running) is itself a driver.

## 4. Attribution discipline

- **Every driver needs a number and, ideally, a headline.** "Oil +1.1% to $85.3 on the 11th night of strikes (20:26 ET headline)" is attribution; "risk-off sentiment" is not.
- **Yields are a coincident reading, never the cause** — find the underlying driver (inflation print, supply, tariffs, geopolitics). See [`pitfalls/22-yields-not-causal.md`](pitfalls/22-yields-not-causal.md).
- Cross-verify anomalous prints before publishing them: a ±5% Asia index change on a quote feed gets checked against daily history (is the regime actually that volatile?) before it appears in the analysis. It was real for KOSPI in July 2026; it will not always be.
- Rank drivers (usually 2–3) by evidence weight, and say which one the *current* tape is obeying when they conflict (e.g., Asia chip euphoria vs war-premium oil → NQ obeys the oil leg).

## 5. Output: scenarios keyed to levels

Base/bull/bear with probabilities summing to 100%, each keyed to: prior settle, overnight high/low, round numbers, and the specific pending catalysts from §3 as the branch conditions. Include the "what would flip this" trigger per branch. VIX level + event density is worth one closing line (cheap vs expensive protection) — as observation, not advice.

## Data-source caveats (this stack, verified 2026-07)

| Source | Caveat |
|---|---|
| TradingView desktop reader | Needs CDP relaunch if the port is down — **relaunch closes the user's charts**; don't do it mid-session without asking. |
| Funda `/v1/quotes?type=commodity-quotes` (FMP proxy) | NQUSD/ESUSD tick sub-minute (verified 45s apart) but carry **no timestamp field**; `volume` is FMP's own aggregation, not CME; no bid/ask. Near-real-time, not exchange-licensed real-time. `ticker` param is ignored — returns all, filter client-side. |
| Funda `/v1/charts?type=5min&ticker=NQUSD` | Works, ET timestamps, but bars **lag 5–15 min** behind the quote — the chart's right edge is not "now." `^KS11` intraday is empty; use live index quote + daily history for Asia. |
| Funda `/v1/calendar` | `limit` caps at 1000 (422 above — easy to swallow in a try/catch and get an empty list). Earnings calendar mixes foreign listings with **local-currency revenue** (KRW rows dwarf USD) and duplicates via 5-letter OTC ADRs (…Y/…F) + preferred share classes (T-PA). Filter before sorting by size. |
| Funda `/v1/quotes?type=index-quotes` | Asia rows update live during their sessions; `^VIX`/`^NDX` are prior-close after US hours. Don't mix the two vintages in one sentence without labeling. |
